## 📌 **Parking Spot Detection System**  
This project is designed to detect empty parking spots in parking areas. Using **Python** and **OpenCV**, it analyzes video streams to identify and differentiate between **occupied** and **vacant** spaces. The system marks parking spaces and monitors their status in **real-time**.

### 🔹 **Manual Configuration of Parking Slot Positions**

#### **1. Prepare Your Image**  
- Place an image of your parking layout (e.g., `first_frame.png`) in the project folder.

#### **2. Mark Parking Slots Using the Mouse**  
- 🖱️ **Left-click** to add a parking slot.  
- ❌ **Right-click** to remove any previously placed slot if needed.

#### **3. Save the Configuration**  
- The script will save the slot positions to a `carparkpos` file.

Once you've manually defined the parking slots, the system will automatically detect and monitor these slots in future video streams! 🚗📹
